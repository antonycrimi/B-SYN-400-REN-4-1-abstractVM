The goal of this project is to create a simple virtual machine that is able to interpret programs that are written
in a simplified assembler language. To be precise, it consists in a stack machine that is able to calculate
simple arithmetical expressions. These very arithmetical expressions are given to the machine in the form
of simple assembler programs.
